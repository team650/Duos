      bio: "Kristen Sanderson is a senior technology and infrastructure executive with more than 20 years of experience navigating the full data center ecosystem, from hyperscale AI environments to edge and modular deployments in supply-constrained markets. As Senior Vice President at Duos Technologies, Inc., she leads strategic growth initiatives across North America, advising customers on resilient procurement strategies, data center deployments, and execution models that mitigate manufacturing delays, labor shortages, and supply chain volatility. Throughout her career, Kristen has built deep working relationships with leading AI hyperscaler and data center manufacturers across power, cooling, connectivity, networking, and infrastructure deployments. Her vendor-agnostic approach enables organizations to preserve basis-of-design integrity while activating pre-approved alternates based on lead time, availability, or cost—without compromising reliability, performance, or standardization. This expertise is especially critical as AI infrastructure demand competes for constrained manufacturing capacity within the Data Center markets. Prior to joining Duos Technologies, Kristen spent more than a decade at Accu-Tech Corporation as Director of Data Center Solutions, where she led enterprise and multi-tenant deployments spanning white space infrastructure, high-density power and cooling systems, custom enclosures, fiber and network architecture, DAS, security, and integrated services. She regularly partnered with hyperscaler-grade manufacturers while tailoring solutions for smaller operators who cannot absorb 50–70 week component lead times. Kristen is widely recognized for her expertise in supply chain resilience for AI and edge data centers, including dual sourcing frameworks, creative procurement alternatives, and materials management strategies that reduce onsite labor requirements. Her experience with phased delivery and construction-aligned logistics has helped eliminate 20–40% of onsite labor hours on complex deployments. She is a strong advocate for modular data center strategies that future-proof AI infrastructure—enabling phased capital deployment, shorter lead times, reduced power and water dependencies, and faster execution compared to large hyperscale builds. Kristen is especially focused on empowering mid-market operators, regional clouds, enterprises, and public sector organizations that are often crowded out of the supply chain by hyperscalers. A multiple-time recipient of Accu-Tech’s President’s Club and the Staples Sales Excellence Award, Kristen is known for translating complex ecosystem dynamics into practical decision frameworks for IT leaders, engineers, and procurement teams. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Colorado Boulder and is a frequent speaker on AI data center supply chain resilience, procurement agility, and execution efficiency.",
